# Arithmetic-Exam-Application-Hyperskill
This is "Arithmetic Exam Application" project form Hyperskill.<br>
Learn how to handle input and output, employ the random number generator, and write the output to a file.<br>
Many people are fond of interactive learning. In this project, you will learn how to write an application that can facilitate solving arithmetic operations in a quick manner. The application will generate a mathematical expression for a user to solve. Implement various levels of difficulty and let the application save the results and show the progress of learning.<br>
Note: This repository contains all files from Hyperskill for evaluating each step of the project and quizes and etc.<br>
